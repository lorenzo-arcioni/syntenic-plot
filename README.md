# BuscoPlotter

BuscoPlotter is a Python library that facilitates the visualization of BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) results by generating syntenic graphs and marker graphs. It uses Matplotlib to create intuitive plots for better interpretation of BUSCO data.

## Features

- **Syntenic Graphs:** Visualize the syntenic relationships between identified orthologs across different genomes.

- **Marker Graphs:** Plot marker gene distributions to understand the conservation of single-copy orthologs.

## Installation

You can install BuscoPlotter using pip:

```bash
pip install busco-plotter
```
